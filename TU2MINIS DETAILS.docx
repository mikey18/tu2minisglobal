HOW TO SETUP PROFESSIONAL EMAIL

Creating professional email addresses like `info@tu2minisglobal.org` or `careers@tu2minisglobal.org` using Google involves using Google Workspace (formerly G Suite). Here's how you can set it up:

Steps to Create Professional Emails with Google Workspace:

1. Sign Up for Google Workspace  
Go to Google Workspace. Click Get Started and follow the prompts to create an account.  

2. Verify Your Domain  
During the setup, you’ll be asked to verify ownership of your domain. This involves adding a TXT or CNAME record to your domain’s DNS settings. The Google Workspace setup wizard will guide you through this step.  

3. Create Email Addresses  
After verifying the domain, you can create email addresses through the Google Admin Console:  
- Log in to the Google Admin Console.  
- Navigate to Users.  
- Click Add User and provide details for each email address you want to create (e.g., "info" or "careers").  

4. Access Emails  
Once created, you can access emails via Gmail (using your new professional email address).  

5. Set Up Billing  
Google Workspace is a paid service, with plans starting at $6/user/month for the basic plan. Make sure to set up billing during the registration process.  

Additional Features:  

You can create aliases like `support@tu2minisglobal.org` for free.
